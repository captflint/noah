# noah

## Overview

Noah is an offline electronic dictionary program still in the *very* early stages of development. It is based on *Webster's Unabridged Dictionary* as provided by the most excellent Project Gutenberg (http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29765). Noah consists of a few python scripts that make using this dictionary more convenient than simply opening it up in a text editor.

As stated above, noah is still in a very early state and not much has been written yet. However, you can look up words by calling "python3 noahcli.py" from a terminal. You can even look up a random word if you want. More features are coming in the (hopefully near) future.

## Planned Features

* Spell check to help uses look up words that they are not sure how to spell
* Fancy GUI with support for minimizing to system tray
* The ability to look up a word in a users clipboard by clicking on the system tray icon
* An ncurses interface for command line junkies
* Look up history
